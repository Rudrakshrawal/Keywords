# ****TYPES OF NETWORK****
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**
- **Campus Area Network (CAN)**
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
# LOAD BALANCER --Distribution of set of task over a set of resources
  ## TCP -IP MODEL -- a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks
  ***It loosely defines a four-layer model***
  ### layer 1 -   ***Application layer***--> create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another or the same host.This is the layer in which all application protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate
   ### layer 2 -   ***Transport layer***--> provides a channel for the communication needs of applications. UDP is the basic transport layer protocol, providing an unreliable connectionless datagram service
  ### layer 3 -   ***Internet Layer***--> This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines IP addresses.
   ### layer 4 -   ***Link Layer***--> includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to affect the transmission of internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts. 
                                  
  ## OSI MODEL -- provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection
  ***Layer Architecture***
   ### layer 1 - ***Physical Layer***-->responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium.
  ### layer 2 - ***Data Link***-->  node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes.[Node-a redistribution point or a communication endpoint.] It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.
  ### layer 3 - ***Network Layer***--> provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in "different networks". 
  ### layer 4 - ***Transport Layer***--> The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destinationhost from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions Breaking large protocol data units or long data streams into smaller chunks called "segments".The process of dividing data into segments is called segmentation                             
  ### layer 5 - ***session Layer***--> The session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a "session"
### layer 6 - ***Presentation Layer***--> handles protocol conversion, data encryption, data decryption, data compression, data decompression, incompatibility of data representation between operating systems, and graphic commands
### layer 7 - ***Application Layer***-->functions typically include file sharing, message handling, and database access, throughthe most common protocols at the application layer, known as HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP

# NAT-(Network address translation) a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
- ****STATIC NAT**** : allows the user to configure one-to-one translations of the inside local addresses to the outside global addresses. It allows both IP addresses and port number translations from the inside to the outside traffic and the outside to the inside traffic.
- ****DYNAMIC NAT**** :does the mapping of a local address to a global address happens dynamically. This means that the router dynamically picks an address from the global address pool that is not currently assigned.
- ****PAT(PORT ADDRESS TRANSLATION)**** :Port Address Translation (PAT) is a function that allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address

# ROUTING -- The process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.
