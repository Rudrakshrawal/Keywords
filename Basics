1.. **ISA** - (Instruction Set Architecture or simply Computer Architecture ) In computer science, an instruction set architecture (ISA), also called computer architecture, is an abstract model of a computer.

2.. **CISC** - (Complex Instruction Set Computer) The fundamental goal of CISC is that a single instruction will handle all evaluating, loading,
    and storing operations, similar to how a multiplication command will handle evaluating, loading, and storing data, which is why itâ€™s complicated.
             __performance__

3.. **RISC** - The fundamental goal of RISC is to make hardware simpler by employing an instruction set that consists of only a few basic steps used for 
     evaluating, loading, and storing operations. A load command loads data but a store command stores data.
              __power__

4.. **ARM** - (Advanced RISC Machines) An Arm processor is one of a family of central processing units (CPUs) based
      on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture for computer processors. [Closed Source]

5.. **RISC-V** - RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture based on established reduced instruction set computer principles.
       Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses. [Open Source]

6.. **Node** - A node is a point of intersection or connection within a network. In computing, a node can refer to a computer, device, 
              or component that is part of a larger network.

7.. **Peripherals** - when data are recieved from or delivered to to a device, that device is reffered to as peripherals

8.. **Cilium** - Cilium is a highly scalable Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI). It provides cloud-native networking connectivity, 
     security, and observability for container-based workloads, such as in Kubernetes and Docker. It provides visibility and control over network traffic, and offers advanced security features.

9.. **Proxmox** - Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is an open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization

10.. **XEN** - Xen is a free and open-source hypervisor that allows multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware at the same time. Xen inserts a virtualization layer between the 
    system hardware and the virtual machines. 
      Xen is a type-1 hypervisor, which means it can be installed directly on hardware without the need for a host operating system

11..  **SRAM** - Static random access memory is the that type of RAM that is fast, has more storage but less memory than DRAM. This type of RAM uses transistors
       instead of capacitors and stores cpu cache. The bits are stored in voltage and consumes less power and generates less heat. This has lower
        latency and high data transfer speed.

             {cache-}a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster;
                      the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.

12.. **DRAM** - dynamic random access memory is the that type of RAM that is slower ,less costlier, has more greater memory access ,uses capacitors
                 has higher latency. These type of RAM uses capacitorsand stores bits in the form of electrical energy and has a greater latency
                  and uses more power and generates more heat.

13.. **DDR SDRAM** - Double data rate synchronous data random access memory class of memory integrated circuits used in computers. DDR SDRAM, also retroactively called 
                     DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM and DDR5 SDRAM.

14.. **GDDR SDRAM** - Graphics DDR SDRAM is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory specifically designed for applications requiring high 
                    bandwidth, e.g. graphics processing units. 

15.. **Kernal** - The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything 
                  in the system. A kernel is the core component of an operating system. Using interprocess communication and system calls, 
                  it acts as a bridge between applications and the data processing performed at the hardware level.

16.. **API** - An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.
                      It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software

17.. **Containers** - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so 
             the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing

18.. **docker** - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
                    . The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

19.. **kubernetes* (K8)- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.


20.. **x86**- an x86 is a family of complex instruction set computer instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel.

21.. **ALU** - an arithmetic logic unit performs the computer's data processing functions

22.. **EDVAC** - Electronic Discrete Variable Computer

23.. **Compiler** -  a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language.
                 This translate source code from a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language to create an executable program.
                  {Used in java,c++,Go,c#}

24.. **Interpreter** - an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring 
                    them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
                          {Used in python,java script, ruby}

25.. **Iteration** -  a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved.
