29.. **RAID** - Redundant Array of Independent Discs is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.
- RAID 0 - **Mirroring** -
- RAID 1 - **Slicing** - writing one set of data in disc 1 and other in disc 2. This totally doubled the performance but the problem that arose wast that if one disc was damaged the other one was unreadable automatically.
- RAID 5 - Data and parity are striped evenly across all of the disks, so no single disk is a bottleneck. Striping also enables users to reconstruct data in case of a disk failure enabling both mirroring and slicing.
- RAID 6 - RAID 6 (Striping with Dual Distributed Parity) It is a data-striping process that utilizes two disks as a backup. The data is striped in the form of blocks and is stored across multiple partitions, including the backup disks. That way, it remains accessible even after two consecutive failures.

44.. **Source code management tool**- Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. 

45.. **CI/CD**-:
- - - Continuous integration is the practice of integrating all your code changes into the main branch of a shared source code repository early and often, automatically testing each change when you commit or merge them, and automatically kicking off a build. With continuous integration, errors and security issues can be identified and fixed more easily, and much earlier in the development process.
- - - Continuous delivery is a software development practice that works in conjunction with CI to automate the infrastructure provisioning and application release process.Once code has been tested and built as part of the CI process, CD takes over during the final stages to ensure it's packaged with everything it needs to deploy to any environment at any time. CD can cover everything from provisioning the infrastructure to deploying the application to the testing or production environment.
    -  In Continuos deployment ,it involves automating the deployment process of successfully tested code to various environments (like testing, staging, or production). Continuous Deployment implies automatically deploying every successful change to production

61..**Load Balancing**-Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.
Different load balancing algorithms provide different benefits; the choice of load balancing method depends on your needs:

- **Round Robin â€“ Requests are distributed across the group of servers sequentially.*

- **Least Connections â€“ A new request is sent to the server with the fewest current connections to clients. The relative computing capacity of each server is factored into determining which one has the least connections.*

- **Least Time â€“ Sends requests to the server selected by a formula that combines the fastest response time and fewest active connections.*

- **Hash â€“ Distributes requests based on a key you define, such as the client IP address or the request URL.*

- **IP Hash â€“ The IP address of the client is used to determine which server receives the request.*

- **Random with Two Choices â€“ Picks two servers at random and sends the request to the
one that is selected by then applying the Least Connections algorithm.*
