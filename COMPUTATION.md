  - - type 1 or Bare-metal hypervisors : installed directly on the physical hardware withouyt an intermediatry OS
    - - KVM , XEN , MICROSOFT HYPER V
    - type 2 or Hosted hypervisors :  run inside the physical host machine's operating system
    - - VMware , PARALLEL DESKTOP, VIRTUAL BOX
- CONTAINER : Containers are software packages that run applications independently of the underlying operating system
- - DOCKER : Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in CONTAINERS
  - LXC : Linux Containers (LXC) is an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a control host using a single Linux kernel
