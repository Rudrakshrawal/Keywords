-  cpu :
- - Control unit (CU): directs the flow of instructions and data
- -  - Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): executes arithmetic and logical operations
- - - Registers: stores temporary data and intermediate results
- - - Primary storage: holds the data and programs that are currently in use
- - - Internal bus: connects the CPU components and transfers data between them
-------------
- dpu  : a programmable computer processor that integrates a CPU with network interface hardware. DPUs are also known as "IPUs (infrastructure processing units) or "SmartNICs"
-------------
- gpu : Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip that renders graphics for display on an electronic device.GPUs are designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing
-------------------
- FGPA- FGPA stands for field-programmable gate array. It's a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing.FPGAs are versatile and can be configured to perform a wide range of digital logic functions.

- HOST: A network host is a computer or other device connected to a computer network.
- - BARE METAL: In computer networking, a bare-metal server is a physical computer server that is used by one consumer, or tenant, only.(server withno os)
- - HOSTED: Server with an OS
- VM: a computer system created using software on one physical computer in order to emulate the functionality of another separate physical computer.
- - Virtualisation : The process that enables the hardware resources of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple vm's.
  - Hypervisor : A hypervisor is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.

  - - type 1 or Bare-metal hypervisors : installed directly on the physical hardware withouyt an intermediatry OS
    - - KVM , XEN , MICROSOFT HYPER V
    - type 2 or Hosted hypervisors :  run inside the physical host machine's operating system
    - - VMware , PARALLEL DESKTOP, VIRTUAL BOX
- CONTAINER : Containers are software packages that run applications independently of the underlying operating system
- - DOCKER : Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in CONTAINERS
  - LXC : Linux Containers (LXC) is an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a control host using a single Linux kernel
 - ORCHESTRATOR : In system administration, orchestration is the automated configuring, coordinating, and managing of computer systems and software(CONTAINERS in simple words)
 - - K8S(KUBERNETES) : Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.
   - EKS : Elastic Kubernetes service
   - ECS ; Elastic Containers Service
